# (Modern) Fortran Practice

In an attempt to strengthen my skills in Fortran, I am undergoing
EverythingFunctional's course titled
[Intermediate Fortran](https://www.udemy.com/course/intermediate-fortran).

This repository contains my solutions to the problems in the course, many of
which are built upon code copied in as a starting point.

As such, while the history of this repo would imply that I am the sole author
of the code therein, I have only made modifications to code originally written
by [EverythingFunctional](https://github.com/everythingfunctional).

I am absolutely open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve any code in
this repo! This was meant as an opportunity to learn, and I wish to continue to
treat it that way.
